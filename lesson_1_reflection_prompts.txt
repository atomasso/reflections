was introduced?

    It gives you an option to choose.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

    Contribution is measurable and easier to track which gives you more insight in your progess.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you make commit in a an incremental and logical way
    Cons: you can forget to commit and mess up your code with some untrackable changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Previous (working) versions are accessable in the file history.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For my personal projects.
